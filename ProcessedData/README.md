# ProcessedData Folder

This folder contains all processed data files that comply with the project's metadata standard. Processed data is stored here temporarily until the transition to a cloud environment is completed. Data here has been cleaned, transformed, and prepared for visualization in a Tableau dashboard.

**Note:** `metadata_template.json` is a metadata template and should be copied for each new dataset but not altered. Each dataset in the `ProcessedData` folder should have its own metadata file created by copying this template and filling in the specific details.
