# Community Safety & Thriving Data Project

This repository contains code and data for a project focused on community safety and well-being. The data and code in this repository support the development of a public-facing Tableau dashboard in collaboration with **ACT NOW** and its local community sites.

## Directory Structure

- **Scripts**: R scripts used to acquire and process data. These scripts follow a standardized workflow to ensure reproducibility and alignment with our metadata standard (currently in development).
- **InputData**: A temporary holding area for raw data. Data here is stored as acquired and is not yet processed.
- **ProcessedData**: All data in this folder has been cleaned, transformed, and adheres to the metadata standard. This folder will eventually transition to cloud storage but currently holds processed data locally.
